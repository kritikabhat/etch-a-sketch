# Etch-A-Sketch
### This project creates a basic sketchboard that can be used in the browser. The goal of the project was to review some of my skills through practice.

--- 
While making this, I revised the following:
* HTML, CSS (UI tricks, common properties, tags)
* JavaScript (DOM manipulation, FlexBox, Node.JS)
* Git (common commands, markup for ReadMe, setup/deployment, Conventional Commits)

```
FlexBox: {
    flex-flow, 
    flex-grow, 
    flex-shrink, 
    flex-basis (flex shorthand)
}
Played around with the properties but ultimately Grid Layout worked best for Sketchboard.
Used FlexBox for parent container.

Templates: {
    Font-Awesome,
    BootStrap
}
Revised but ended up not using for this simple project.

Input Range Slider {
    Designed own slider
    -webkit-appearance: none; (overidden by `appearance: none`)
    -webkit-slider-runnable-track
    -webkit-slider-thumb
}


```
